## Reflection
This was a course project at the end of 2nd year of Computer Science bachelor at the Dnipro University of Technology.

The task was to design the database for the imaginary gas company that is operating with their customers and gas meters.

This project was challenging for me at first. I got quickly passed through learning adaptive layout and single-page application development.
But when I got to the server side, I faced the first challenges.

Still, I managed to learn and gain practical experience in designing and developing the front-end part of applications,
concepts of REST APIs, authentication, and authorization using JWT tokens.
